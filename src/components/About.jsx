        I am an aspiring software developer with a good foundation in JavaScript
        and growing expertise in frameworks like React.js, Node.js, and
        Three.js. I have worked on some projects using these technologies, which
        have helped me gain hands-on experience, but I know there’s still a lot
        to learn. As a quick learner, I’m always eager to explore new concepts
        and improve my skills. My focus is on building full-stack applications
        that are interactive, user-friendly, and efficient. I enjoy working on
        real-time projects that challenge me and expand my knowledge. I am
        passionate about developing innovative solutions and refining my ability
        to create seamless digital experiences. I'm excited to continue
        learning, experimenting, and collaborating on projects that push my
        skills further. Let’s build something amazing together!
